# CasinoGame
Game that allows you to pick a lucky number and bet on that number

In this game, I use techniques such as functions, randomization, loops, if statements and many other techniques.

In this game, you are given $10 to start with. For each round, you choose how much to bet. If you lose all the $10, you get 2 additional trials ($10 for each trial).
For one trial, you choose a number and then Python generates a luck number. You earn three times the amount you bet if your number matches the generated number.
You earn 0.5 the amount you bet if your number matches the evenness or oddness of the generated number. The trial ends until you lose all the money.
You lose your bet money if your number doesn't meet any of the above criteria (e.g your number is odd whereas the generated number is even).
